# hello-world
What's this then?

My background is in Geoscience and I have worked in the Oil and Gas sector for 10 years. I am now looking to take the data analytic skills I have developed and apply them in a different area and I can see coding is going to help me stay ahead of the curve.

Working in a team to develop pragmatic and beautfly simple solutions for complex tasks is what it's all about.
